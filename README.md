# Matrix_Calculator
This program can perform most common operations on matrices, including:
* addition
* multiplication
* substraction
* transposition
* finding determinant using Gaussian elimination
* finding inverse matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination
## Other functions
Additionally, this project includes Least Squares Approximation, Jacobi, and Seidel methods to find the approximate solution of Ax = b.
These methods are implemented in Matrix_Calculator/Least_Squares_Approximation.cpp, Matrix_Calculator/Jacobi_Method.cpp and Matrix_Calculator/Seidel_Method.cpp.
