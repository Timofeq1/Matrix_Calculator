# Matrix_Calculator
This program can perform most common operations on matrices, including:
* addition
* multiplication
* substraction
* transposition
* finding determinant using Gaussian elimination
* finding inverse matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination
## Other functions
Additionally, this project includes [Least Squares Approximation](Matrix_Calculator/Least_Squares_Approximation.cpp), [Jacobi](Matrix_Calculator/Jacobi_Method.cpp), and [Seidel methods](Matrix_Calculator/Seidel_Method.cpp) to find the approximate solution of Ax = b.
